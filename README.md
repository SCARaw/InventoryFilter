# Inventory Filter mod for Fallout 2

A mirror repository of the Inventory Filter mod for Fallout 2 by **Mr.Stalin**, based on the idea of JimTheDinosaur's [_Inventory Sort Buttons_ mod](https://www.nma-fallout.com/threads/inventory-sort-buttons-mod.203180).

## Features:
* Quickly find ammo for weapons from tons of junk in the inventory: if you click the middle mouse button on the "Weapons" and "Ammo" menu buttons, these items will be displayed simultaneously in the list.
* Money is always shown at the top when bartering, or if the "All" filter is selected (the feature does not work right after opening the inventory).
* Quickly exchange your party members when bartering or opening containers.
* Displays the weight value for items in the selected category, as well as the number of coins the merchant has in barter.
* The "Drop/Give All" button.
* Hotkeys to switch between the selected categories.
